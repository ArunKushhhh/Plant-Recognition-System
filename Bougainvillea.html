                <h2>Cultivation and uses</h2>
                Bougainvillea are popular ornamental plants in most areas with warm climates, including Florida, South Carolina, South India, California, across the Mediterranean Basin.

                Bougainvillea can be used as a houseplant or hanging basket in cooler climates. In the landscape, it makes an excellent hot season plant, and its drought tolerance makes it ideal for warm climates year-round. Its high salt tolerance makes it a natural choice for colour in coastal regions. It can be pruned into a standard, but is also grown along fence lines, on walls, in containers and hanging baskets, and as a hedge or an accent plant. Its long arching thorny branches bear heart-shaped leaves and masses of papery bracts in white, pink, orange, purple, and burgundy. Many cultivars, including double-flowered and variegated, are available.

                <h2>Toxicity</h2>
                The sap of bougainvillea can cause serious skin rashes, similar to Toxicodendron species.
