                <h2>Characterisitics</h2>
                Banyans bear their fruit in the form of a structure called a <i>"syconium".</i> The syconium of Ficus species supply shelter and food for fig wasps and the trees depend on the fig wasps for pollination.
                <br><br>
                The leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy, green, and elliptical. Like most figs, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales abscise. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge.
                <br><br>
                Older banyan trees are characterized by aerial prop roots that mature into thick, woody trunks, which can become indistinguishable from the primary trunk with age.
