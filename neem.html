                <h2>Weed Status</h2>
                Margosa is considered as a weed in many areas, including some parts of the Middle East, most of Sub-Saharan Africa including West Africa and Indian Ocean states, and some parts of Australia. Ecologically, it survives well in similar environments to its own, but its weed potential has not been fully assessed.
                <h2>Phytochemicals</h2>
                Margosa fruit, seeds, leaves, stems, and bark contain diverse phytochemicals, some of which were first discovered in azadirachta seed extracts, such as azadirachtin established in the 1960s as an insect antifeedant, growth disruptor, and insecticide. The yield of azadirachtin from crushing 2 kg of seeds is about 5 g.
                <br>
                In addition to azadirachtin and related limonoids, the seed oil contains glycerides, diverse polyphenols, nimbolide, triterpenes, and beta-sitosterol. The yellow, bitter oil has a garlic-like odor and contains about 2% of limonoid compounds. The leaves contain quercetin, catechins, carotenes, and vitamin C

                <h2>Medicinal Uses</h2>
                Products made from margosa trees have been used in the traditional medicine of India for centuries, for treating skin troubles and rheumatism, but there is insufficient clinical evidence to indicate any benefits of using margosa for medicinal purposes. In adults, no specific doses have been established, and short-term use of margosa appears to be safe, while long-term use may harm the kidneys or liver; in small children, margosa oil is toxic and can lead to death. Margosa may also cause miscarriages, infertility, and low blood sugar.

                In Southern India and the Middle-East, neem twigs are often used as a teeth-cleaning twig.
